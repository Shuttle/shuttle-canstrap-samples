# shuttle-canstrap-samples

**Note**: this package is still in development.

Provides samples showing how to use [shuttle-canstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shuttle-canstrap) components.

## Getting started

Open a command prompt and install the packages from the samples folder (where `package.json` resides):

```
npm install
```

Then host the samples folder using any appropriate `http` server.  If you have installed [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) you can run as follows:

```
http-server
```

Once the server starts navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/default.html` to view the site.
